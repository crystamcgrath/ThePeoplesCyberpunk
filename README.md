Player sheet for the table-top game, to keep scores
This is my first project. This is a site to keep score while playing IRL. After the information is entered into the fields, click save, and this will download a .json file into your downloads folder. A new file is downloaded every time, not updated. When you start a new session, choose your file from the input file options and your information will be filled in.
